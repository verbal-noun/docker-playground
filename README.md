# Docker Playground
The best way to learn is hands-on. This repo map my jounrey of learning docker by doing countless random projects and experiments. The best (and quickest) way to learn docker is certainly by doing it.

I'm putting this repo to both serve as a guide to others who want to learn docker by doing various hands on activities. As well as a knowledge hub for me to revisit.

> I learnt by experimenting a lot, which means the tasks I did not necessarily have a narrative. I've tried to group them together so it gives some structure.
